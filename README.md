# No Problem by IRIS

Here is the source code to No Problem by IRIS, an Oric-1/ATMOS demo released at
NOVA 2023.

I didn't release the sources right away because they were a mess, and I wanted
to tidy them up and properly document them before releasing them, but several
months later I realised that I'm just never going to get around to doing that,
so I'm afraid the sources are still a big mess.

The demo is generated by a C program that you run on your computer. The program
contains a 6502 assembler, and the C code essentially acts as the preprocessor
generating the source and compiling it and spitting out a tap image at the end.

Under the "prototypes" folder are some self contained programs that I used to
generate data for the main demo.

Enjoy! And sorry it's such a mess.
